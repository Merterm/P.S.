Dear Kakubo,

Draw a CHAIN at position [15,0].

Best Wishes. 

(This function will be used in making the chain)
P.S I defined the function Make-Circle at position[x,y] as the following: 

Please, 
Draw oval using color yellow also using length[1] width[1] at position[x,y].
Thank you. 


P.P.S I defined CHAIN at position[x,y] as the following:
Please, 
CHAIN has Temporary-Number.
Temporary-Number is 0. 

Until, Temporary-Number is 20, 
Please, 
Make-Circle at position[x,y].
x assign x plus 2. 
y assign y plus 2. 
Thank you. 

Thank you.
