# P.S!
Programming language in the form of a letter.

## Introduction
The main ideology behind P.S! is describing a shape to a friend as if writing a letter. The name P.S! comes from the P.S. (Post Scriptum) in a letter, and the ! denotes a special meaning in our program, as explained in later sections. P.S! is a letter type programming language and will be compiled by a compiler named Kakubo, which means “drawing robot” in Japanese. The source code will look like an actual letter that people write and send to a friend giving instructions on some tasks. Therefore, the language is as human readable as possible, which is what makes it different from most other programming languages. Since P.S! is a figure-drawing programming language the main purpose of it is to draw shapes, from basic built-in ones to complex ones defined by a user. The programming language is made in such way that a user needs to be polite for the program to work. There are some reserved words like “please”, “thank you” or “dear”, that make sure that a user is polite in that sense. Therefore, we can say that authors of P.S! are propagating humanness and politeness.  The idea of creating a letter type programming language came to us, while we were brainstorming for this CS315 project. While brainstorming we started to imagine that we were giving instructions to a friend. This is when we had our “eureka!” moment.
